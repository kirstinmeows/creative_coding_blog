At the start of this blog I had no knowledge that p5 even existed, and now I've created over 30 p5 sketches!

Although I may not have developed my skill set to a professional or even advanced level, I am still very happy and proud of the things I have learnt and progress I have made.  I hope to continue using creative coding, and gaining more confidence in my work!
