This post looks into the process of sharing my work and the intention behind it! 

The thought of sharing my creative coding to the world is quite daunting. I often keep my creative work to myself, worried about not meeting expectations.  
I decided to simplify the idea, focusing on making intention refined design choices.  At the beginning of the project the idea was to have words generated based on key emotions, the user would then pick multiple words, which would then determine the colour values and the speed of blob, creating a unique blob representative of the emotions chosen. 

Whilst the concept is executable, considering the timeframe and my amateur skill set I decided to simplify the concept by running through 10 key words which upon being clicked will display a mood blob depicting the emotions associated with the key word.  In simplifying the idea, I had to focus more on the intention behind each blob and the design choices in order to ensure the meaning behind the work is communicated to the group. 

Since I was going to be presenting the work to my CoP digitally, it leaves little room for a verbal explanation of project.  The title of the work itself 'mood ring', a reference to the rings you would buy from the $2 store.  As most members of my community are similar in age the reference will provide enough context as to the purpose behind the words and blobs.  I also provided small instructions when sharing the work via text and email. 

Based on the responses, the words and blobs were successful in provoking the intended emotions from the viewer with people being able to make the association from the key word and visuals back to the core emotion.  Whilst it was successful, I believe there is lots of room for development within the project, circling back to the first idea of combining multiple emotions to create a more personally tailored blob.  The use of `lerpcolor()` could be replaced with a custom gradient function allowing for the blob to transition between multiple colours/moods. 

Overall I am very pleased with the final work, I found a strong interest in exploring more organic shapes in p5 as well as learnt how to use the JS HTML DOM.  This project is definitely something I want to continue to explore and work on in my own time, so I would call it successful!
