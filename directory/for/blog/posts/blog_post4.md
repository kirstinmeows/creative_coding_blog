P5 has three ways to interact with the mouse through the stored data e.g. `mouseX`, `mouseY`, through the mouse buttons e.g. `mouseisPressed`, `mouseButton` and through the mouse event functions e.g. `mousePressed()`, `mouseDragged().  
I will be focusing on the use of the mouse data and mouse events
