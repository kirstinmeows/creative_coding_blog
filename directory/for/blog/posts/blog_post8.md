This post is mainly about experimenting with grids and how to create them.  I first began by looking at the sketches and explanation used in Thomas Capogreco's [Iteration blog post](http://thomas.capogre.co/rmit/ccs/2022/08/21/iteration.html), i used this as a reference to create the below sketches.

A nested `for` loop allows for the shapes to be iterated horizontally through the first `for`, while also iterating the the second loop of vertical shapes.
