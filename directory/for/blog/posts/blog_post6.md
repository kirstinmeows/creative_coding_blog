*I like to think of this sketch as a face, perhaps even a self portrait* 

Whilst P5 has many built in shape functions, such as those demonstrated above (`square()`, `ellipse()` & `triangle()`), P5 also allows for us to build custom shapes using functions such as `beginShape()` & `endShape()`.
I followed along to [The Coding Train's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76fiD5DvzeQ) video on custom shapes, which gives and amazing explanation as to how these functions work and some of the possibilities of the shapes you can create.

Here's my sketch I created using the guidance from the video linked above, as well as some experimentation with HSB colours.

These custom shapes are also explored in the previous post, with the star shapes.  Here are some other strange stars.
