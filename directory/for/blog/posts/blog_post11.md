Community of practice: **friends** 

*"True friends are usually those who offer you support, improve your quality of life, promote self-confidence, provide honesty and unconditional love"* 

The one key factor that ties all friends together is the emotional connection between one another.  When looking at my on a surface level they all seem to have very different interests and lack many common connections.  Although when diving deeper all of my friends share similar core values and attitudes, with a common interest in creative practices and art.  [Here](https://www.businessinsider.com/common-similarities-between-friends-2018-4#:~:text=Friends%20tend%20to%20share%20similar,hobbies%2C%20beliefs%2C%20and%20interests.) is some further reading on the connections between friends from a scientific perspective.
Some of the core values and attitudes of the group, which led to form the key concepts of the artwork for AT3: 

**Imagination**
The wonder of imagination.  The interest in imagining other worlds and possibilities. 

**Emotion** 
A key part of the friendship itself is the emotional support and connection between people, these emotions shared with one another form memories. 

**Visual aesthetic** 
My friends are all very visual learners, many of their hobbies are creative leading them to value pretty aesthetics and colours.
