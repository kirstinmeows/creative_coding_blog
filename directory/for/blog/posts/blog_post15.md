A breakdown of the artworks and their design choices! 

## tranquil

The colour green was chosen to provoke calmness and zen, a very slight gradient of the blob to a darker green.  The movement of the blob is free but controlled, representative of a meditative state.  The colour palette inspired by matcha.

## clouds

The blob is inspired by bubbles, shifting slowly from a sheer purple to green mimicking iridescence.  The title representing 'head in the clouds', implies imagination and magic.  The combination of green and purple often associated with fantasy. 

## rage

The stark contrast of red against black, mimicking a fire meant to symbolise rage.  The gradient shifts quickly like waves and anger, with the frantic and restrained movement of the blob showing the bottled up emotion.
