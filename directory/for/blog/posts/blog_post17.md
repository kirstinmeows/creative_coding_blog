## confetti

As suggested by the title, the theme of this blob is party.  Stemming from being energised, high saturation colours as well as the gradient of the background create a vibrant almost chaotic feel.  The speed of the movement and the colours were chosen to feel like dancing.

## knot

The work knot is often associated with tightness and restraint, the title hinting to the anxious intention of this blob.  The colour purple is associated in pyschology with anxiety, combined with the fast and contained movement of the blob, it aims to be unsettling and anxiety-ridden.  The blob fading in and out represents the urge to withdraw from uncomfortable situations.

## wilting

The tones of grey and blue set a soft but down feel.  The colour and blob shifts slowly portraying the low energy of sadness and depression.  Similar to void the muted tones lack energy or intensity, providing a more calm sense of solitude.
