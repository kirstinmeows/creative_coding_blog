## confetti

As suggested by the title, the theme of this blob is party.  Stemming from being energised, high saturation colours as well as the gradient of the background create a vibrant almost chaotic feel.  The speed of the movement and the colours were chosen to feel like dancing.

## void

The title void is drawn from the feeling of numbness and tiredness.  The blob fades in and out of the background symbolising the lack of energy, provoking feelings of sleepiness as the animation can also be interpreted as eyes opening and closing.  The lack of colour and grey tones setting a grim mood.

## delight

One of the more simple concepts, with the warm colour choices promoting happiness and comfort.  The slow transition of colour in contrast to the faster movement, shows energy and light.
