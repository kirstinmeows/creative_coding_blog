Deciding on 10 moods for the basis of the [mood ring](https://editor.p5js.org/kirstinmeows/full/34J-pgklr).

Starting with the basic emotions, then looking at the overall mood which is associated with this emotion.  I researched into word association and experimented with various word association generators.  I originally began experimenting with the idea of generating words associated with a key emotion using the Word Associations Network API.  Although the concept was strong, the words generated were often too literal, not matching the intended abstract vibe.  I did still find the research very interested and useful for future projects, you can read more about how the API works [here](https://wordassociations.net/en/api-doc).

ChatGPT provided the most successful word associations when given a key emotion,  allowing me to specify for more abstract associations.  This was used as a tool to help develop the blob titles and key 'moods' of the piece, as based of each of the 10 emotions explored below.

1. Calm => Meditate => Tranquil

2. Euphoric => Utopia => Clouds (head in the clouds)

3. Anger => Rage

4. Love => Affection => xoxo (kisses and hugs)

5. Tired => Numb => Void  

6. Happy => Joy => Delight 

7. Energised => Party => Confetti 

8. Scared => Anxious => Knot (a knot in your stomach)

9. Lonely => Need a friend => Companion 

10. Sad => Blue => Wilting
