This post is about making shapes dance ! 

P5 allows you to 'animate' shapes by changing the values of the shape over time.  In this case we explore changing these values within the `draw()` function, which runs on a default `frameRate` of 60 fps.  This default `frameRate` creates a 'smooth' movement as the time between frames is usually too fast for the eyes to perceive.

P.S the title to this post was my attempt at a joke (╥_╥)
