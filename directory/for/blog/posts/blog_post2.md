Randomness refers to the lack of predictability in an event or it's outcome.  It can be seen as having no discernible pattern, and the result cannot be predicted with strict certainty. 

Within p5 it refers to the built in function `random()`, which allows for a random value to be returned (further information can be found [here](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random)).
